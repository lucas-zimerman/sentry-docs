Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already. You'll also need to enable the <PlatformLink to="/">base Sentry integration for ASP.NET</PlatformLink>.

### Entity Framework Integration

Starting with Sentry 4.0.0, the SDK automatically integrates with Entity Framework whenever available. The integration is automatically activated if your project match the following condition:
* Includes `Sentry.Entity.Framework` or higher

If you don't want to have this integration, you can disable it on `SentryOptions` by calling `DisableDiagnosticSourceIntegration();`

```csharp
using Sentry;

option.DisableDiagnosticSourceIntegration();

The captured spans are the following: 

* Operation: `db.query`

: Can return multiple rows.

* Operation: `db.query-scalar`

: Can return a single run.

* Operation: `db.execute`: 

: Return no rows, usually an operation like INSERT, DELETE,...
